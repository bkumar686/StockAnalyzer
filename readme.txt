Name: Stock Prediction and Analyzer Tool

Description: This tool will allow for traders to be able to analyze stocks through different
technical metrics like Bollinger Bands, Regression, RSI, and more. You are able to view
any stock graph over different time periods. You can also view their other metrics 
and basic descriptors like their EPS and 52 week high values. In addition, you will be able to view basic information regarding the technical analysis. Using this tool, you can get acquainted with the basics of stock trading and use it as research for when you want to invest. 

How to Run:
The stockgraph.py file will need to be run. It is the only file that will need to be run to 
test out this program. All the features can be run through this file as it is multistep and 
will have different pages in the program that can be navigated. You will need to also have
the CMU graphics file also. This is already in the zip file. When prompted for user input,
it is advised to use the format shown in the message for the program to analyze and output
results. 

Libraries used:
The libraries that are used in this are pandas, yfinance, and numpy. I imported statistics 
and datetimes to help with helper functions and calculations. The first three were used to
work with the data given from yfinance and make dictionaries that will allow for data to be
extracted and transformed. 

Shortcut Commands:
There aren't any particular shortcut commands. All keypresses for changing states or showing
different technical indicators are shown on the screen. For example b for bollinger bands, r for
going back, i for the RSI, and l for the linear regression.
